# Pattern Application

## Introduction
 A Pattern Application is a Application which displays the user selected pattern with the user given input size. This help to play with the patterns and can learn how to code different pattern with the logic associated with each of them. As patterns are basic logic building blocks for coding skills like competitive coding also required basic analysis which can be gained by this build and playing with this Application   

## Background
 As a Project should stand out different when there are alot of members are participating, therefore I was thiniking to do something quite creative to build and it should make other to make simple to use and simple to gain knowledge. Then I remember the problems/issue while understand and build the pattern coding. That small struggle of learn coding made into an idea to work on this project.  

## Objective
 To implement a Pattern Application where User can specify the pattern and size of selected pattern.

## Cost and Features
* Free of Cost to Build and Use
* Open to use any number of users
* Open Source Anyone can contribute for the improvement of the application
* Easy to Use and Easy to Gain Knowledge

## Defining Our System
 A Simple Pattern Application Where different Patterns are available, the user can choose a pattern and size of pattern which will be printed. This Application runs continues until the user want to terminate it.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
 It is a Simple Application Where anyone can use it.

## What:
 It is used for easy understanding of different patterns and it's logic for various sizes.

## When:
 It is used to recap the basic of coding logic analysis and to gain the difficulties in it.

## Where:
 It can used by every Engineering aspirant as logic building are foundations for the problem solving.

## How:
 This project was implemented using multi file programmming in C.
